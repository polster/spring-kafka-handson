= Spring Kafka Hands-on
:toc:

== Introduction

=== What's this?

This project demonstrates how to use Spring Kafka and Spring Boot to implement simple event-driven microservice, while using hexagonal architecture to decouple the business logic from the infrastructure and ease testing.

=== Pre-requisites

* Java 17
* Maven 3.8
* Docker, Docker Compose
* Make

=== Infrastructure

The included infrastructure for local testing consists of:

|===
| Resource | Description

| http://localhost:8081/ui/artifacts[]
| Schema registry UI

| http://localhost:4502/swagger-ui/index.html[]
| Swagger UI

| http://localhost:8083[]
| Kafka UI

== Get Started

=== Initial setup

* Git clone this repo and cd into it
* Provision the local dev env:
[source,bash]
----
make docker-infra-up
----
* Check its status:
[source,bash]
----
make docker-infra-status
----

=== Verification

* Build all modules and start one of the services:
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run -pl services/orders
----
* Check the schema registry UI at http://localhost:8081/ui/artifacts[] and verify that the `OrderPlaced` schema is registered
* Check the Kafka UI at http://localhost:8083[] and verify that the `orders` topic is created
* Check the Swagger UI at http://localhost:4502/swagger-ui/index.html[] and verify that the `orders` endpoint is available (feel free to POST a new order)
